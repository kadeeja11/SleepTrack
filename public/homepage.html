        <h2>Importance of Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The way you feel while you are awake depends in part on what happens while you are sleeping.
            During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.
            In children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term) health problems.
            It can also affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory system, Metabolism ,
            respiratory system, and immune system and how much sleep is enough.</p>
        <h4>Heart and circulatory system</h4>
        <p>When you fall asleep and enter non-REM sleep, your blood pressure and heart rate fall. During sleep, your parasympathetic system controls your body,
            and your heart does not work as hard as it does when you are awake. During REM sleep and when waking, your sympathetic system is activated, increasing your
            heart rate and blood pressure to the usual levels when you are awake and relaxed. A sharp increase in blood pressure and heart rate upon waking has been
            linked to angina, or chest pain, and heart attacks.</p>
        <p>People who do not sleep enough or wake up often during the night may have a higher risk of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Obesity</li>
            <li>Stroke</li>
